# cpp-bubbles
Collection of independent and useful pieces of C++ 

cpp-bubbles is a collection of small pieces of c++ code (a bubble) which are useful in a lot of different use cases.
cpp-bubbles aims for portability and minimal dependencies. Each bubble can be copied into a codebase and used on its own, or a codebase could link against cpp-bubbles.

A bubble is a single header, or header plus compilation unit.
Each bubble comes with a small description of usage and a test-driver which serves both as example and test.

# Current collection of bubbles:
* NamedValue, a simple template Wrapper for the Named Value idiom
